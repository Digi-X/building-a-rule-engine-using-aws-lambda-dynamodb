Example, could be financial systems adjustment to market dynamics and consumer behavior in real time.  They process vast amounts of data and using robust rules engines make critical decisions without the end user ever noticing.   Each transaction flows through a set of complex rules and conditional checks before an action can be taken.

**Purpose:**

This guide helps to implement a simple rule engine frameowrk and how to externalize rules stroing in DynamoDB and finally use Lambda and DynamoDB stream to fire those rules.
